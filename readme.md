# ClimateQuest

ClimateQuest is a prototype that explores a playful approach of presenting data related to global warming. It presents you with a topic, gives you a related challenge and thereby demonstrates how everyone has the potential to make an impact. It was developed from scratch within two days during the course [Prototyping Interaction](https://www.umu.se/en/education/courses/prototyping-interaction) in the [Human Computer Interaction and Social Media](https://www.umu.se/en/education/master/masters-programme-in-human-computer-interaction-and-social-media/) Master's program at [Ume√• University](http://www.umu.se/english). The goal of the assignment was to prototype ways of interacting with open data based on Paul Dourish's ideas on Embodied Interaction.

You can access a live version of the prototype at <http://climatequest.a-ph.net>.

## Browser Compatibility

The prototype was developed for and tested on the latest version of Google Chrome for Mac (55.0 at the point of writing). Although it should work on other modern Browsers as well, you might experience some glitches.
